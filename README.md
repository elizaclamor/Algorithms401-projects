# Algorithms401-projects

This repository includes all group projects completed by our group of 5 excellent coders. Although most commits are made through 2 accounts, the group work was mainly carried out in class together and committed by one. 

This work was completed for the Algorithms 401 class in Fall 2022 at New Jersey City University. The class grade received was an A for all members of this group.
